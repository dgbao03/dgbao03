# Hi there. I'm Baoishereee ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I'm a student majoring in Information Technology. 

In my leisure time, I love to build things especially projects that are practical and helpful. I have learned a lot from working on them and I hope that these repositories can be helpful to you in some way.
