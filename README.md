# Hi there. I'm Baoishereee 👋

## About me
I'm a student majoring in Information Technology. 

In my leisure time, I love to build things especially projects that are practical and helpful. I have learned a lot from working on them and I hope that these repositories can be helpful to you in some way.

I'm proficient in several programming languages including **Java**, **JavaScript (JS)**, and **TypeScript (TS)** — with **Java** being my main language and strongest skill set. 

The one project I'm most proud of is [X Crawling System (Java)](https://github.com/dgbao03/x-crawling-system). Feel free to check it out to see what it's about 😁.
